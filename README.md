# Bagisto API Platform

Comprehensive REST and GraphQL APIs for seamless e-commerce integration and extensibility.

[![Run in Postman](https://run.pstmn.io/button.svg)](https://www.postman.com/bagisto-apis/bagistoapi)

## Requirements

- PHP 8.3+
- [Bagisto](https://github.com/bagisto/bagisto) **v2.4.10** (the version this package is tested against in CI)
- Composer 2
- MySQL 8.0+ or PostgreSQL 14+
- API Platform for Laravel — `api-platform/laravel` and `api-platform/graphql` (`~4.3.8`), which bring in the remaining `api-platform/*` components at a matching version, installed automatically via `composer require`

## Installation

### Method 1: Quick Start (Composer Installation – Recommended)

The fastest way to get started:

```bash
composer require bagisto/bagisto-api
php artisan bagisto-api-platform:install
```

Your APIs are now ready! Access them at:
- **API Landing**: `https://your-domain.com/api`
- **REST API Docs (Shop)**: `https://your-domain.com/api/shop/docs`
- **REST API Docs (Admin)**: `https://your-domain.com/api/admin/docs`
- **GraphQL Playground (Shop)**: `https://your-domain.com/api/graphiql`
- **GraphQL Playground (Admin)**: `https://your-domain.com/api/admin/graphiql`
 
### Method 2: Manual Installation

Use this method if you need more control over the setup.

#### Step 1: Download and Extract

1. Download the BagistoApi package from [GitHub](https://github.com/bagisto/bagisto-api)
2. Extract it to: `packages/Webkul/BagistoApi/`

#### Step 2: Register Service Provider

Edit `bootstrap/providers.php`:

```php
<?php

return [
    // ...existing providers...
    Webkul\BagistoApi\Providers\BagistoApiServiceProvider::class,
    // ...rest of providers...
];
```

#### Step 3: Update Autoloading

Edit `composer.json` and update the `autoload` section:

```json
{
  "autoload": {
    "psr-4": {
      "Webkul\\BagistoApi\\": "packages/Webkul/BagistoApi/src"
    }
  }
}
```

#### Step 4: Install Dependencies

```bash

composer require \
  api-platform/laravel:~4.3.8 \
  api-platform/graphql:~4.3.8
```

#### Step 5: Run the installation
```bash
php artisan bagisto-api-platform:install
```

#### Step 6: Environment Setup (Update in the .env)
```bash
STOREFRONT_DEFAULT_RATE_LIMIT=100
STOREFRONT_CACHE_TTL=60
STOREFRONT_KEY_PREFIX=storefront_key_
STOREFRONT_PLAYGROUND_KEY=pk_storefront_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx 
API_PLAYGROUND_AUTO_INJECT_STOREFRONT_KEY=true
```

## Exporting the API Schema

Generate schema files for the shop and admin APIs — OpenAPI JSON (REST) and GraphQL SDL — to import into Postman, a client/code generator, or a mock server without calling a live server:

```bash
php artisan bagisto-api-platform:export-schema
```

The files are written to `schema/generated/`:

| File | Contents |
|---|---|
| `openapi-shop.json` / `openapi-admin.json` | OpenAPI for each REST surface |
| `shop.graphql` / `admin.graphql` | GraphQL SDL for each surface |
| `graphql-operations-shop.json` / `-admin.json` | Every root GraphQL field mapped to its resource tag |

Each spec is scoped to its own surface — the storefront spec carries no admin path, schema or tag, and the reverse — and the command refuses to write one that leaks the other surface or references a definition it does not include.

Options:

- `--path=<dir>` — write elsewhere
- `--transport=all|rest|graphql` — limit to one transport (default `all`)

Re-running overwrites those six files and nothing else. To rebuild the Postman collections from them:

```bash
php schema/tools/build-collection.php
```

## Postman Collections

Run them from the [public workspace](https://www.postman.com/bagisto-apis/bagistoapi), or import the copies that ship with the package:

- `collections/Bagisto-Shop-API.postman_collection.json` — storefront: browsing, cart, checkout, orders, account
- `collections/Bagisto-Admin-API.postman_collection.json` — admin, foldered to mirror the admin sidebar
- `environments/Bagisto.postman_environment.json` — one environment for both

Both transports are covered: requests are foldered `REST/` and `GraphQL/` under the same resource names, with GraphQL split into `Queries/` and `Mutations/`.

### Importing

1. Postman → **Import** → pick a file from `collections/`.
2. Postman → **Environments** → **Import** → pick `environments/Bagisto.postman_environment.json`, select it, then fill in your values.

| Variable | Used by | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `url` | Both | Your Bagisto URL, e.g. `http://localhost:8000` |
| `storefrontKey` | Shop | Storefront API key, from admin → Configuration → API |
| `customerEmail` | Shop | A storefront customer's email |
| `customerPassword` | Shop | That customer's password |
| `customerToken` | Shop | Filled in by the Customer login request |
| `cartToken` | Shop | Filled in by the Create cart token request |
| `adminToken` | Admin | Integration token, from admin → Settings → Integration |
| `locale` | Both | Locale code, defaults to `en` |
| `channel` | Both | Channel code, defaults to `default` |
| `currency` | Shop | Currency code, defaults to `USD` |

Fill in only what the collection you are using needs.

### Authenticating

**Shop** — run **REST → Customer → Customer login**. It stores `customerToken`, which every other request sends as the bearer. For a guest cart, run **Create cart token** instead and set the collection's **Authorization** tab to `{{cartToken}}`; the cart and checkout endpoints serve guests and logged-in customers alike, so the token you send decides whose cart you are working on.

**Admin** — there is no login request. Generate an integration token in the admin panel (see [Admin API Authentication](#admin-api-authentication)) and paste it into `adminToken`.

### Keeping them current

`schema/tools/build-collection.php` regenerates the collections from the exported schemas, so a collection follows the API rather than being maintained by hand. Three workflows keep the published copies in step: **Validate** checks the files on every push, **Push Collections to Postman** publishes them to the official workspace when they change on `main`, and **Sync Collections from Postman** pulls edits made in Postman back into the repository on a release. All three refuse to move a real storefront key.

Values in the requests are placeholders — replace them with records that exist on your store. Postman's **Auto Fetch** runs a schema introspection query that costs far more than a normal request; switch it off if the GraphQL folders feel slow.

## Admin API Authentication

Admin endpoints (`/api/admin/*` and `/api/admin/graphql`) require an integration-token Bearer header:

Authorization: Bearer id|generated-token


To generate a token:

1. Log into the Bagisto admin panel.
2. Enable the module first: navigate to **Configuration → API → Integration → Module Settings** and turn **Enabled** on. (Without this, the Integration menu stays hidden.)
3. Navigate to **Settings → Integration**.
4. Click **Create**, fill in the name / description / assigned admin / permission mode (`All`, `Custom`, or `Same as Web`) / optional IP allowlist / rate limits / expiry, and save as a draft.
5. Click **Generate**. The plaintext token is shown **once** — copy it immediately. You won't be able to view it again; if lost, use **Regenerate** to issue a new one.

Each token is scoped to a single admin user and inherits that admin's role permissions — so tokens can never do more than their owner could in the admin UI. To issue tokens to multiple admins, create one token per admin (each admin can hold only one active token at a time).

Tokens can be revoked at any time from the same page or via the signed link in the lifecycle notification email sent to the token owner.
