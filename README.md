# Bagisto API Platform

Comprehensive REST and GraphQL APIs for seamless e-commerce integration and extensibility.

## Requirements

- PHP 8.3+
- [Bagisto](https://github.com/bagisto/bagisto) **v2.4.7** (the version this package is tested against in CI)
- Composer 2
- MySQL 8.0+ or PostgreSQL 14+
- API Platform for Laravel — `api-platform/laravel` and `api-platform/graphql` (`~4.3.8`), which bring in the remaining `api-platform/*` components at a matching version, installed automatically via `composer require`

## Installation

### Method 1: Quick Start (Composer Installation – Recommended)

The fastest way to get started:

```bash
composer require bagisto/bagisto-api
php artisan bagisto-api-platform:install
```

Your APIs are now ready! Access them at:
- **API Landing**: `https://your-domain.com/api`
- **REST API Docs (Shop)**: `https://your-domain.com/api/shop/docs`
- **REST API Docs (Admin)**: `https://your-domain.com/api/admin/docs`
- **GraphQL Playground (Shop)**: `https://your-domain.com/api/graphiql`
- **GraphQL Playground (Admin)**: `https://your-domain.com/api/admin/graphiql`
 
### Method 2: Manual Installation

Use this method if you need more control over the setup.

#### Step 1: Download and Extract

1. Download the BagistoApi package from [GitHub](https://github.com/bagisto/bagisto-api)
2. Extract it to: `packages/Webkul/BagistoApi/`

#### Step 2: Register Service Provider

Edit `bootstrap/providers.php`:

```php
<?php

return [
    // ...existing providers...
    Webkul\BagistoApi\Providers\BagistoApiServiceProvider::class,
    // ...rest of providers...
];
```

#### Step 3: Update Autoloading

Edit `composer.json` and update the `autoload` section:

```json
{
  "autoload": {
    "psr-4": {
      "Webkul\\BagistoApi\\": "packages/Webkul/BagistoApi/src"
    }
  }
}
```

#### Step 4: Install Dependencies

```bash

composer require \
  api-platform/laravel:~4.3.8 \
  api-platform/graphql:~4.3.8
```

#### Step 5: Run the installation
```bash
php artisan bagisto-api-platform:install
```

#### Step 6: Environment Setup (Update in the .env)
```bash
STOREFRONT_DEFAULT_RATE_LIMIT=100
STOREFRONT_CACHE_TTL=60
STOREFRONT_KEY_PREFIX=storefront_key_
STOREFRONT_PLAYGROUND_KEY=pk_storefront_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx 
API_PLAYGROUND_AUTO_INJECT_STOREFRONT_KEY=true
```

## Exporting the API Schema

Generate schema files for the shop and admin APIs — OpenAPI JSON (REST) and GraphQL SDL — to import into Postman, a client/code generator, or a mock server without calling a live server:

```bash
php artisan bagisto-api-platform:export-schema
```

The files are written to `schema/generated/`:

| File | Contents |
|---|---|
| `openapi-shop.json` / `openapi-admin.json` | OpenAPI for each REST surface |
| `shop.graphql` / `admin.graphql` | GraphQL SDL for each surface |
| `graphql-operations-shop.json` / `-admin.json` | Every root GraphQL field mapped to its resource tag |

Each spec is scoped to its own surface: the storefront spec contains no admin path, schema, or tag, and the admin spec contains no storefront one. The command refuses to write a schema that leaks another surface, references a definition it does not include, carries an unused definition, or contains a storefront key.

Options:

- `--path=<dir>` — write to a different directory
- `--transport=all|rest|graphql` — limit to one transport (default `all`)

Re-running overwrites those six files and nothing else. `schema/tools/build-collection.php` turns the exported specs into the Postman collections; it takes the target directory as an argument:

```bash
php schema/tools/build-collection.php /path/to/bagisto-api-collection/collections
```

## Postman Collections

[![Run in Postman](https://run.pstmn.io/button.svg)](https://www.postman.com/bagisto-apis/bagistoapi)

Ready-to-import Postman collections for both API surfaces live in their own repository:

**[github.com/bagisto/bagisto-api-collection](https://github.com/bagisto/bagisto-api-collection)**

Import a collection and its environment there, fill in your store URL and a key, and every endpoint is ready to send — REST and GraphQL, for both the storefront and the admin API. That repository is the one to point clients and integrators at; this package holds the schemas the collections are generated from.

## Admin API Authentication

Admin endpoints (`/api/admin/*` and `/api/admin/graphql`) require an integration-token Bearer header:

Authorization: Bearer id|generated-token


To generate a token:

1. Log into the Bagisto admin panel.
2. Enable the module first: navigate to **Configuration → API → Integration → Module Settings** and turn **Enabled** on. (Without this, the Integration menu stays hidden.)
3. Navigate to **Settings → Integration**.
4. Click **Create**, fill in the name / description / assigned admin / permission mode (`All`, `Custom`, or `Same as Web`) / optional IP allowlist / rate limits / expiry, and save as a draft.
5. Click **Generate**. The plaintext token is shown **once** — copy it immediately. You won't be able to view it again; if lost, use **Regenerate** to issue a new one.

Each token is scoped to a single admin user and inherits that admin's role permissions — so tokens can never do more than their owner could in the admin UI. To issue tokens to multiple admins, create one token per admin (each admin can hold only one active token at a time).

Tokens can be revoked at any time from the same page or via the signed link in the lifecycle notification email sent to the token owner.
